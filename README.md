# Introduction
This is the work in progress for many years to come of my home lab. I finally decided that I'm going to have one
to toy around with technologies, as well as getting my home setup more robust and from which I will be
proud of. I will list all of the physical and programs that I will/intend to use.


## Roadmap 2023
#### January (half month)
- Make a list of what I could look for in terms of physical resources
- Budget / find cheap alternatives if need be
